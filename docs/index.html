	<h1>Maracas</h1>
	<p>
    Maracas is a source code and bytecode analysis framework⁠—written in Java with the help of Spoon—designed to analyze how Java libraries evolve and how their evolution impacts their clients.
    Maracas is built atop JApiCmp, a static analysis tool that computes the delta between two releases of a Java library.
    With the help of Spoon, Maracas then detects broken uses on client code.
