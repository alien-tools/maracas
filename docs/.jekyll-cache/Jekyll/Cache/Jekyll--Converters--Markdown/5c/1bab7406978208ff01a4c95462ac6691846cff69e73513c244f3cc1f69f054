<p>Maracas is a source code and bytecode analysis framework⁠—written in Java with the help of Spoon—designed to analyze how Java libraries evolve and how their evolution impacts their clients.
Maracas is built atop JApiCmp, a static analysis tool that computes the delta between two JAR (Java ARchive) files of a Java project.
Thanks to JApiCmp, Maracas computes the list of breaking changes introduced between two versions of a library, and⁠—with the help of Spoon⁠—detects broken uses on client code.</p>
