<p>Maracas is a source code and bytecode analysis framework‚Å†‚Äîwritten in Java with the help of Spoon‚Äîdesigned to analyze how Java libraries evolve and how their evolution impact their clients.
Maracas is built atop JApiCmp, a static analysis tool that computes the delta between two JAR (Java ARchive) files of a Java project.
Thanks to JApiCmp, Maracas computes the list of breaking changes introduced between two versions of a library, and‚Å†‚Äîwith the help of Spoon‚Å†‚Äîdetects broken uses on client code.</p>
